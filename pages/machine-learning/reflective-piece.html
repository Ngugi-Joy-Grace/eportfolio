                <h3 class="major">An Introspective and Reflective Piece</h3>
                <p>
                    This module has significantly broadened my knowledge and skills, both technical and in soft skills. This reflective piece will cover the content explored during the module, the skills acquired, and the impact it has had on my career as a data scientist.
                </p>

                <strong>Content Covered During the Machine Learning Module</strong>
                <p>
                    The module began with an <code>Introduction to Machine Learning</code>, laying the foundation by explaining key concepts and terminologies. I learned about the history of machine learning, then transitioned to the different types of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning) and explored when each type is used.
                </p>




                <p>
                    Next, was <code>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).</code> Wickham and Grolemund (2023) emphasise the importance of EDA, stating,
                </p>
                <p>
                    “EDA is an important part of any data analysis, even if the questions are handed to you on a platter, because you always need to investigate the quality of your data. Data cleaning is just one application of EDA: you ask questions about whether your data meets your expectations or not. To do data cleaning, you’ll need to deploy all the tools of EDA: visualisation, transformation, and modelling.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    This unit taught me how to preprocess data, handle missing values, and visualise data distributions to uncover underlying patterns and insights. EDA is essential for understanding the dataset at hand and making informed decisions about subsequent modeling steps. Through various visualisation techniques and transformations, I learned to identify outliers, detect anomalies, and ensure the integrity of data before proceeding with more advanced analyses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The module then transitioned to <code>Clustering techniques</code>, with a specific focus on <code>K-Means Clustering</code>. In this unit, I explored the theory behind clustering algorithms, learning about the different types of clustering methods and their applications. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together based on their features (Wu, 2021). I came across various clustering algorithms, including hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, and K-Means, and discussed when each method is appropriate. For example, K-Means Clustering is suitable for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets or clusters, making it effective for applications such as market segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following clustering, I studied <code>Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)</code> and <code>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</code>. These units were particularly challenging and fascinating, as they delved into the intricacies of neural networks. I learned about the architecture of ANNs, the role of activation functions, and how CNNs leverage spatial hierarchies in data, making them powerful for image recognition tasks. Understanding these complex models required a deep dive into their underlying mathematics and practical implementation which enriched my knowledge profoundly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The module also covered <code>Model Evaluation and Selection</code>, emphasising the importance of choosing the right metrics and techniques to assess model performance. I explored various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC, and learned how to select models based on these criteria. This unit underscored the significance of rigorous model evaluation in building robust machine learning systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, I explored <code>Industry 4.0 and 5.0</code>, discussing the evolution of industries driven by advanced technologies. This unit highlighted the role of machine learning in transforming manufacturing and industrial processes, and the ethical, social, and professional concerns associated with these advancements. The discussion on Industry 5.0 was particularly insightful, as it emphasised human-machine collaboration and the need for ethical considerations in technology deployment.
                </p>



                <strong>Skills Gathered During the Module</strong>
                <p>
                    Through the machine learning module, I was able to gain a variety of skills, both soft and technical, which I discuss below:
                </p>

                <strong>Technical Skills:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Preprocessing and EDA: Although I already had experience in this area, I believe in the importance of relearning and unlearning to stay updated with the latest techniques and methodologies. The module reinforced my skills in handling and preprocessing data, identifying patterns, and visualizing data insights.</li>
                    <li>Clustering Algorithms: Developed a strong understanding of clustering techniques, particularly K-Means, and their practical applications.</li>
                    <li>Neural Networks: Acquired in-depth knowledge of ANNs and CNNs, including their architecture, functioning, and implementation using popular libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras. I also got into the mathematics behind neural networks, gaining insights into concepts such as backpropagation, gradient descent, and activation functions.</li>
                    <li>Model Evaluation: Learned to evaluate models using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing models based on comprehensive evaluation criteria. Additionally, I gained skills in identifying overfitting in ANN and CNN models and mitigating it through techniques like early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalisation. These skills are crucial for ensuring that machine learning models generalise well to new, unseen data and maintain high performance in real-world applications (Sewak et al., 2018).</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Soft Skills:</strong>

                    <li>Collaborative Research: I engaged in collaborative research, which involved pooling knowledge and resources to tackle complex problems. This collective effort was essential in addressing the challenges we faced, as it allowed us to leverage the diverse expertise and perspectives within the team.</li>
                    <li>Consciousness in Communication: I learned to balance the delivery of information to avoid sounding overbearing, ensuring a collaborative and respectful team environment. This involved being mindful of how I presented my ideas and actively listening to others.</li>
                    <li>Time Management: Time management was another critical skill that was tested and improved during this module. Balancing multiple assignments and another demanding module required meticulous planning and prioritisation. In retrospect, I realise that some assignments needed more time than initially allocated, and this introspection has taught me to better estimate the time required for complex tasks in the future.</li>
                </ul>

                <strong>Impact on My Career</strong>
