                    The initial contact with the team was made via email to establish rapport and decide on the collaborative tools to be used. It was agreed that Slack would be our primary communication tool, GitHub for version controlling and sharing our code, and Google Docs for collaborating on the analytical report.

                    In this meeting, we reviewed and signed the team contract to ensure everyone was aligned with our goals. We then moved to the agenda, which involved reviewing the notebook with the initial data preparation. We discussed the dataset to understand it better and brainstormed potential business analytic questions. Various ideas were proposed, but we decided to take more time for review and research before finalising a specific question.

                    During this meeting, we shared our research findings on potential business analytic questions. We discussed the requirements for each question and decided to focus on a broader topic: geospatial analysis of the Airbnb dataset. However, we recognised the need to narrow down the focus to ensure we could explore it thoroughly and effectively.

                    At the request of one of the team members, the meeting day was moved to Tuesday. In this meeting, we continued our discussion on refining our focus within the geospatial analysis topic and started planning the specific steps and tasks needed to achieve our project goals.

                    Due to the rescheduling of the Monday meeting, we also moved the Thursday meeting to Friday. During this meeting, we outlined the requirements for the analytical report. We discussed the importance of tailoring the report for an executive board, emphasising the need for clear visuals and concise, non-technical content. We agreed that the report should effectively communicate our findings and recommendations without overwhelming the audience with technical jargon. This approach would ensure that the executive board could easily understand and act on our insights. Additionally, we created a Google Doc for the report, and each team member agreed to gather relevant content that would help in populating the critical discussion. Upon request of a team mate we decided the Monday meeting for the following week would be held on Tuesday.

                <p>
                    Entering this week, we recognised the urgency of finalizing the data analysis. We decided to focus our specific business question on analysing the different factors affecting the dynamics of Airbnb listings, based on the progress of our analysis. This provided clear direction for the report and clarity for the person responsible for compiling it. To ensure thorough preparation, we also agreed to hold meetings on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday (submission day) that week. This intensive schedule aimed to allow ample time for final adjustments and to address any last-minute issues.

                <strong>Thursday, 18 April 2024 TO Monday, 22 April 2024: 8:00 PM TO 9:00 PM (GOOGLE MEETS)</strong>
                <p>
                    These meetings mainly focused on iterative changes and finalizing of the project. The first draft of the report was ready on Sunday and the group leader agreed to do the final changes before submission and reduction of the word count to the required limit of 1000(+10%) words. The team leader shared the final draft before the Monday meeting which everyone agreed to, we all agreed to it, and he went ahead and uploaded it to Turnitin to check the similarity report. The similarity report was at 5%, with this we went ahead and submitted the artefacts.
