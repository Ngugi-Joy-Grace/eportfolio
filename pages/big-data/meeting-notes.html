							<p>
								This was the initial meeting, and all the members were in attendance. We went through the
								instructions for the database design report assignment and decided that the first step was to
								come up with a problem statement/domain from which we will focus our report on and begin the
								data collection. We decided to go for a web scraping project and several domains were suggested
								like job market analysis by scrapping job listings websites, product price comparison, real
								estate listings scrapping, etc. By the meeting's conclusion, we had generated an extensive list
								of viable web scraping projects and compiled a set of resources related to web scraping. This
								information was subsequently shared on our collaborative discussion forum and the date and time
								for the next meeting was set.
							</p>
						</div>

						<button class="button fit accordion" style="margin-bottom: 1em">Wednesday, 30 August 2023: 8:00 pm to

						<div class="panel" style="display: none">
							<p>During our second team meeting, after a thoughtful deliberation, we unanimously decided to pursue
								a project centred on scraping real estate listings. We recognized the importance of specificity
								in our project to ensure a comprehensive and in-depth analysis. With this in mind, we chose to
								concentrate our efforts on Manhattan's real estate market, selecting Zillow as our primary
								platform.</p>
							<p>To maintain structure and clarity in our approach, we outlined key deliverables to be
								accomplished by our next meeting:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Structure of the Report: This will provide a clear roadmap of our research, ensuring each
									section seamlessly leads to the next, offering a cohesive narrative. Each member was asked
									to come up with a structure of the report backed by research and present it in the next
									meeting where we would merge our ideas.
								</li>
								<li>GitHub Repository: We decided to set up a dedicated repository for our code to ensure
									transparency, ease of collaboration, and version control. This will also serve as a platform
									where team members can review and contribute code in a centralized manner.
								</li>
								<li>Data: It was emphasized that obtaining relevant and accurate data is paramount. It was
									decided that all team members will attempt to scrape Manhattan for-sale real estate listings
									data from Zillow and share their findings in the next meetings.
								</li>
								<li>Introduction: Having already decided on the problem statement and domain, it was decided
									that we start up on the introduction section of the report to set the tone and context of
									our research. I volunteered to do this section.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>As we adjourned the meeting, each member was clear about their responsibilities, ensuring a
								streamlined approach leading up to our next meeting.</p>

						<div class="panel" style="display: none">
							<p>At our third meeting, we commenced the meeting by presenting the deliverables decided upon in our
								last session.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Structure of the Report: The proposed structure was presented, delineating how the report
									would flow, from introduction to conclusion. The different sections of the report were
									assigned to the respective group members as well.
								</li>
								<li>GitHub Repository: Having set up a GitHub repository for the code, different issues had come
									up with the access of the repository since it was a private repository. This was addressed
									during the meeting to make sure all the members had access to the repository.
								</li>
								<li>Data: Preliminary data from Zillow regarding Manhattan real estate listings was shared. From
									this the important entities that would form the elements of the real estate database were
									decided. These were: property details, agent and agency and price history.
								</li>
								<li>Introduction: The drafted introduction was read out, highlighting the project's objectives,
									methodology, and the overarching significance of our findings in the context of Manhattan's
									real estate landscape. The group members were satisfied with the introduction, and it was
									added to the final document.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Post-presentation, while the deliverables were deemed satisfactory, a significant concern was
								raised regarding the data collection method. Members pointed out the limitations of traditional
								web scraping methods - especially considering the sheer volume and dynamic nature of real estate
								listings on Zillow. Traditional scraping would not only be time-consuming but also might miss
								out on real-time updates, thus affecting the reliability of our dataset.</p>
							<p>After a robust discussion, we collectively decided to pivot our strategy. To enhance efficiency
								and accuracy, we opted to use a web scraping API named "Scrapeak." This tool promised not only
								faster scraping speeds but also a more streamlined process, potentially sidestepping issues like
								website blocks and the necessity of continuous manual updates.</p>
							<p>The meeting concluded with tasks being redistributed considering our new approach, ensuring that
								each member was aligned with the next steps, especially centred around integrating and
								maximizing the potential of Scrapeak.</p>
							<p>The deliverables for the next meeting were set to be an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and an
								initial discussion into the data management pipeline.</p>
						</div>
						<button class="button fit accordion" style="margin-bottom: 1em">Sunday, 9 September 2023: 8:00 pm to

						<div class="panel" style="display: none">
							<p>The meeting began promptly, with an air of anticipation given the pivotal stage our project had
								reached. Our focus was to review the deliverables from our previous meeting and delve deeper
								into the heart of our database design and management.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): The team unveiled an ERD, visually representing the
									logical structure of our database. The diagram delineated the various entities identified
									from the real estate listings, their attributes, and the relationships between them. It
									offered insights into primary keys, foreign keys, and the cardinalities of relationships.
									The ERD was lauded for its clarity and comprehensive nature, capturing the essence of the
									Manhattan real estate data and how it interconnected. Some minor feedback and adjustments
									were discussed, with suggestions for possible refinements like having .
								</li>
								<li>Data Management Pipeline: A preliminary overview of our data management pipeline was
									presented. This overview detailed the step-by-step process of how data would flow from its
									point of origin on Zillow, through Scrapeak, and into our database. It touched upon the
									initial scraping, data cleaning and normalisation, database design, and eventual retrieval
									for storage. The team recognized the importance of this pipeline in ensuring data integrity,
									efficiency, and timeliness.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>After reviewing the deliverables, our attention shifted to a crucial decision point: the choice
								of the database management system (DBMS). Several members presented arguments for various DBMS
								options, taking into consideration ease of integration with other tools and most importantly we
								had to consider a DBMS that was within our skillset. It was unanimously decided to go for MySQL
								DBMS.</p>
							<p>The meeting concluded on a note of progress. Every member grasped the importance of the impending
								week, which marked our final stretch before the report submission. Recognising the urgency, it
								was unanimously agreed that meetings for the upcoming week on Monday, Tuesday and Sunday would
								be essential. Specific timings for these sessions would be determined and communicated on the
								days because of the differing schedules.</p>

							<p>The meeting commenced with the presentation of the draft for our database design report. All
								members actively engaged in a thorough review, pinpointing areas of strength and identifying
								sections that needed further refinement. A significant oversight was identified; the report
								lacked a concluding section. It was unanimously agreed upon that a well-structured conclusion
								was crucial, not only to recap the tasks undertaken in the report but also summarise the
								findings. As a result, drafting a conclusion was set as a priority deliverable for our next
								meeting on Sunday. Additionally, the importance of proofreading was emphasised. The team decided
								to allocate dedicated time for a collective review, ensuring that the report was free of errors
								and maintained a consistent structure and flow. We recognized the urgency of the tasks at hand,
								given the submission deadline, and resolved to intensify our efforts in the upcoming days.</p>

							<p>For this meeting, the conclusion that was designated as a deliverable during the previous session
								was reviewed and edited. Following this, the team embarked on a collective proofreading session.
								Every section of the report was reviewed, and necessary corrections were made to ensure clarity
								and correction of any grammatical errors. After all the team members were satisfied with the
								document structure and content, the document was submitted on Turnitin to check on the
								similarity report. The similarity score was at 4%, within the allowable limit and the cited work
								was referenced. Having done all this and the document completed, the team planned to meet the
								next day at 10:00 pm EAT, to submit the report.</p>

							<p>This meeting was necessary for the tutor to offer more clarification into the feedback given.
								Several key factors were brought up by the tutor such as avoiding descriptive writing but rather
								focus on critical discussions. Questions also arose on the structure of the executive summary
								and how to include the technical aspects. The tutor advised that two paths can be followed: one
								can either include the code snippets or explain the code and actions, the preferred one being
								the second point.</p>

						<h3 class="major">Team Meeting: Executive Summary</h3>
						<button class="button fit accordion" style="margin-bottom: 1em">Friday, 29 September 2023: 10:30 pm to
							11:30 pm EAT. (feedback discussion in-house)
						</button>
						<div class="panel" style="display: none">
							<p>This meeting was set up to discuss the feedback given by the tutor for the database design
								report. Several key points came up:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Knowledge and Understanding: It was acknowledged that while the report was strong in
									theoretical aspects, it lacked a balanced application focus. The team resolved to include
									more real-world applications, possibly by elaborating on real estate listing scenarios where
									the database design was applied or would be beneficial.
								</li>
								<li>Application of Knowledge and Understanding: Concerns were raised about the report's
									theoretical objectives and the lack of clear company requirements. It was decided to revisit
									the objectives and align them with practical needs of a real estate company. A suggestion
									was made to come up with a use case study to anchor the database's practical application.
								</li>
								<li>Data Management Pipeline and Database Logical Design: The team agreed that a clearer flow
									between these sections was needed. It was decided to provide specific examples or
									illustrations on how stages of the data management pipeline directly impacted decisions made
									in the database logical design.
								</li>
								<li>Criticality: The team recognised the need for deeper critical analysis, especially in
									linking theory with practice. It was suggested to not only cite references but also to
									critically analyse them in relation to the practical work being done. The conclusion should
									also be expanded upon, offering more in-depth reflections and discussions.
								</li>
								<li>Structure and Presentation: The tutor noted that while the structure was deemed
									satisfactory, the report lacked evidence of data scraping from the website. It was decided
									that inclusion of snippets of the code used for scraping and possibly sample datasets to
									give a more comprehensive view of the work done would have been a better option. It was also
									noted that introduction was quoted as being too long and filled with filler words that could
									have otherwise been applied towards relevant content of the report.
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>The discussion into the various points from the tutor’s feedback was imperative to make sure that
								similar mistakes are not made for the executive summary report.</p>
							<p>In addition to this, initial discussion into the executive summary report structure was done and
								the following were decided on: a report structure defined, assigning of tasks into creation of
								the database and writing of the report content and the next meeting date. The meeting was
								adjourned and work into the executive summary report begun.</p>
