						<h3 class="major">Deciphering Big Data Module: An Introspective and Reflective Piece</h3>
						<p>Madeline Hunter’s (N.D.) quote ‘If you want to feel secure, do what you already know how to do. If you want to be a true professional and continue to grow… Go to the cutting edge of your competency, which means a temporary loss of security. So, whenever you don’t quite know what you’re doing, know you’re growing’, resonates deeply with my experience in the deciphering big data module. This module challenged me, pushed me beyond my comfort zone, compelling me to venture into uncharted territory. At times, I felt like I was navigating through a metaphorical black box, with uncertainty shrouding my path. However, as I will demonstrate in this reflective piece, I can confidently assert that I have emerged as a more adept and versatile data professional.</p>
						<p>This module was structured around seven distinct categories, covering topics ranging from the Introduction of Big Data Technologies to Data Sources, Data Cleaning, Database Design, Compliance, Technologies, and Future prospects in the field.</p>
						<p>The initial phase involved learning the fundamental concepts of big data. This encompassed exploration of the unique characteristics that define big data, such as volume, velocity, variety, and veracity (Castrounis, 2016). Additionally, the different data types and formats were covered, gaining a deeper insight into structured, semi-structured, quasi-structured and unstructured data. Given my background in Computer Science, I found myself already familiar with many of these concepts. However, the concept of quasi-structured data introduced a new layer of complexity and intrigue to my understanding, reminding me that even in a field I thought I knew well, there were always opportunities for growth and expansion of knowledge.</p>
						<p>In the exploration of data sources, I gained a profound appreciation for the diverse origins of data in today's digital age. This phase enlightened me on data's multifaceted nature, stemming from structured sources like CSV to semi-structured sources like JSON and XML, as well as unstructured data like text and images. I learned the importance of selecting the right data sources to ensure relevancy and quality, understanding that this decision significantly impacts the entire data wrangling process (Kazil & Jarmul, 2016). Additionally, it was here that I delved into the intricacies of collecting data through web scraping, parsing not only structured data like Excel spreadsheets but also extracting valuable information from JSON files.</p>
						<p>Transitioning to the Data Cleaning phase, I underwent an evolution in my data handling skills. Before, I viewed data cleaning as identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, tackling missing values, and addressing outliers within datasets (Chu et al., 2016). However, this module provided a paradigm shift in my perception. I came to appreciate that data cleaning is not just a one-time task but an iterative and intricate process that demands active user involvement and continuous refinement (Ormonde, 2017).</p>
						<p>The Database Design phase of this module marked the most pivotal moment in my learning journey. It was here that I delved into the different activities that go into creating a database, from defining data models to implementing data management strategies (Toerey et al., 2010). I gained understanding of various database models, such as relational and non-relational each tailored to specific data needs. This phase equipped me with the skills to assess the unique requirements of a data project and choose the most suitable database model for optimal data organisation and retrieval.</p>
						<p>Furthermore, this knowledge was put to the test during the team projects that required the design, implementation, and documentation of a database. These projects were twofold, requiring an initial report on database design and an executive summary on the design and implementation of the database. This phase of the module proved to be both challenging and illuminating, reinforcing Madeline Hunter's quote.</p>
						<p>Collaborating within a team presented a unique set of challenges, requiring me to re-adjust my already established schedule to synchronise with other team members' timelines. Initially, this adjustment felt overwhelming as it exceeded my initial expectations and workload.  Despite these challenges, I was compelled to adapt and find a new approach to assignment management that would accommodate the needs of all team members. Working closely with teammates often meant being subjected to different viewpoints and approaches, which served as a valuable learning experience. It was through these interactions that I learned to embrace constructive criticism and incorporate diverse perspectives into my work. This phase underscored the essence of growth and adaptability, demonstrating that true professional development often emerges from navigating through challenging but rewarding team dynamics (Munro & Laiken, 2003).</p>
						<p>The Compliance phase of this module involved a comparison between the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Kenya's Data Protection Act. The GDPR, with its stringent requirements on data handling, emerged as a gold standard in data protection, while Kenya's Data Protection Act demonstrated the nation's commitment to aligning with international data privacy principles. Additionally, the team projects which involved scraping data from Zillow platform, illuminated the importance of reviewing and complying to terms and conditions, to ensure legal and ethical data collection. As a data professional, this phase brought out the importance of understanding and adhering to data protection laws and demonstrating ethical and compliant data practices.</p>
						<p>The final phase of the module involved a glimpse into the technologies and future of big data analytics, including SQL and NoSQL databases, highlighting their roles in data storage and management. I also delved into transaction management, concurrency control, and the essential ‘ACID’ (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties, crucial for data integrity and reliable concurrent data access in database systems. On the future of big data analytics, the module’s content focused on machine learning, but my personal learning led to the discovery of the emerging trend of generative Artificial Intelligence. Generative AI's potential to autonomously create data, simulate scenarios, and drive innovative solutions was a captivating revelation (Baidoo-Anu & Ansah, 2023). This offers a peek into a future where AI-driven algorithms can not only analyse data but also generate entirely new datasets, transforming how we perceive and interact with information. This I believe is the real future of big data analytics.</p>
						<p>As I conclude this module, I do so with a profound sense of accomplishment, armed with a wealth of knowledge and practical experience. Looking ahead, I recognise the importance of ongoing improvement in my Python programming skills through consistent practice and hands-on engagement with real-world projects. Additionally, I acknowledge the need to enhance my abilities in team management, particularly given my inclination to assume leadership roles in team assignments. To create more cohesive and effective groups, I understand that the strength of a team lies in the collective efforts of all its members (Mishra & Shah, 2009).  Hence, I am committed to refining my teamwork skills and fostering a collaborative environment that maximizes our collective potential.</p>
