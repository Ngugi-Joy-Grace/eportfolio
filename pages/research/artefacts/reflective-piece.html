                <h3 class="major">AN Introspective and Reflective Piece</h3>
                <p>
                    My experience through the research methods and professional practice module has been transformative, significantly reshaping my understanding of academic research, writing, and their practical applications. This reflective piece aims to explore the evolution of my research skills, the challenges I encountered, and the insights gained from navigating the complexities of becoming an academic writer and critical thinker. Drawing from the course content which focused on the research methods process, statistical analysis with spreadsheets, writing a literature review and finally a research proposal presentation, I reflect on how each component contributed to my growth and development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of research is to explore, describe, and explain (QuestionPro, 2021). A significant portion of this module was dedicated to this and was tested through the literature review and research proposal assignments. For instance, the process of defining a research gap and formulating research questions from a broad topic was particularly enlightening. Initially, I selected the topic of "Implementing Deep Learning Techniques in Customer Profiling." This topic was intentionally broad, presenting a challenge that required me to identify specific research gaps and develop precise research questions. Through critical engagement with the literature and iterative refinement, I narrowed my focus to investigating how multimodal data can be used in e-commerce customer profiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This process was not merely an academic exercise but a profound learning experience that underscored the importance of precision and clarity in research. Reflecting on this progression, I acknowledge the essential role that clear research questions play in guiding the research direction and addressing specific gaps (Dawson, 2019). Furthermore, the module covered methodology and research design, which are critical components of any research. Understanding various research methodologies—qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods—allowed me to appreciate the strengths and limitations of each approach (Weyant, 2022). I applied mixed methods for my research proposal and literature review because they allow for a comprehensive understanding of the research problem through robust analysis of numerical data and an in-depth exploration of contextual factors (Johnson et.al , 2007). In addition to this, I learned to develop research designs that ensure reliability and validity, effectively address research questions, and mitigate potential biases (Saunders & Bezzina, 2015). This knowledge was crucial when I crafted my research proposal, as it required a clear articulation of my chosen methodology and design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the other hand, a crucial aspect of the research methods process is the integration of statistical analysis, which plays a pivotal role in interpreting and validating research findings (Sirisilla, 2022). Within this module, the application of statistical analysis was particularly emphasised through the use of spreadsheets. My experience in statistical analysis prior to this module was mostly with Python and R. However, learning to apply statistical analysis through spreadsheets provided a new perspective and enhanced my ability to handle data in different formats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Spreadsheets offer powerful tools for organising, analysing, and visualising data, making them indispensable for researchers. They provide a user-friendly interface for performing complex calculations and statistical tests, making data analysis accessible even for those with limited statistical expertise (McFedries, 2022). Through practical exercises in this module, I developed proficiency in using spreadsheets to conduct various statistical analyses, such as hypothesis testing like t-tests, data visualisation with bar charts and histograms, descriptive statistics and summary measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This experience triggered an important reflection for me on when to use R, Python, or Excel for statistical analysis. Each tool has its strengths and appropriate contexts for use. For instance, Excel is highly suitable for smaller datasets and quick, ad-hoc analyses due to its intuitive interface and built-in functions (McFedries, 2022). It is particularly useful for generating immediate visualisations and performing straightforward statistical tests. On the other hand, Python and R are more powerful for handling larger datasets and conducting more complex analyses. Python, with libraries like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, excels in data manipulation, numerical computations, and creating advanced visualisations (McKinney, 2022). R, with packages such as dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2, is particularly strong in statistical analysis and data visualisation, making it ideal for in-depth data exploration and modelling (Wickham & Grolemund, 2023). Understanding the strengths and limitations of each tool has enhanced my ability to choose the most appropriate software for different research tasks, and better problem solving at an industry level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reflecting introspectively on the skills I have gained through this module; I realise that my journey has been beyond just acquiring knowledge but also about transforming my approach to research and academic writing. Upon commencing this module, I expected to improve my research and academic writing skills, and these were indeed rigorously tested. However, two specific aspects emerged as particularly impactful in my development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One significant lesson came from Steven Pinker's book, The Sense of Style. Pinker (2014) highlights the importance of avoiding the "curse of knowledge," a cognitive bias where experts forget what it is like to be a novice and fail to present information in an accessible manner. I realised, though later, that my literature review was riddled with this "curse of knowledge". I had not presented my ideas and findings in a way that was comprehensible to readers from diverse backgrounds. I now realise the importance of writing clearly and effectively, ensuring that my research can be understood by a broader audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the module taught me the importance of being a cautious and reflective writer. In academic writing, it is vital to present views with a balanced perspective, weighing the pros and cons with sufficient evidence (Graff & Birkenstein, 2021). This approach ensures that arguments are robust and credible. Through the various writing assignments and feedback sessions, I honed my ability to critically evaluate sources, construct well-supported arguments, and present them clearly and persuasively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Concluding this reflection, I look back at a module that was a constant cycle of learning, re-learning, and unlearning. Learning because I honed new skills in statistical analysis with spreadsheets particularly Microsoft Excel. Re-learning because I had to repeatedly revisit and reinforce concepts in the research methods process to cement my knowledge. Unlearning because I needed to discard old habits and misconceptions that hindered my progress, particularly in the realm of clear and effective communication. This module often pushed me to points of doubt, especially when my grades, which are usually distinctions, dropped to merits in two assignments. Once I assessed the situation objectively, I realised I was giving this module my best, particularly while working full-time. This experience taught me that this module required just a bit more effort and dedication from me. As Henry Ford (Andersen, 2013) once said, "Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently."
